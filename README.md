# Vulnerable Login Web App

A beginner-friendly, intentionally vulnerable web login application built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed for learning purposes, to demonstrate common security flaws in client-side authentication mechanisms.

## Features

- Simple **Login** and **Register** pages
- User session stored using **localStorage**
- Profile page displaying logged-in user's username
- No backend server — purely front-end for demo/testing

## Files Included

- `index.html` — Login page
- `register.html` — User registration page
- `profile.html` — User profile page
- `style.css` — Basic styling (not uploaded in this demo)
- `script.js` — Front-end logic for authentication (not uploaded in this demo)

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Register a new account.
4. Login with the registered credentials.
5. You’ll be redirected to the profile page if successful.

## Disclaimer

**This project is intentionally insecure and should not be used in production environments.**  
It’s designed for educational and demonstration purposes only — to help beginners understand why client-side-only authentication is insecure.
